TODO

Primarily a consumer-oriented specification, for smart home devices.

Adopted in 2022 by the major vendors (Apple, Google, Amazon, and Samsung) to standardise smart home products.

The standard includes local control of devices, multiple controllers, Matter over WiFi, and Matter over Thread, with provisioning over Bluetooth.

Thread (<https://www.threadgroup.org/>) is an IPv6 only low power mesh networking protocol (based on 6LoWPAN) than allows long life battery powered devices.

Although primarily aimed at the consumer market, many functions are be applicable in commercial and industrial settings, e.g. temperature sensor readings, on/off commands, bootstrapping, firmware over-the-air, etc, and the wide availability in the consumer market may make it easy to adopt as a standard.
